# 👋 Hi there, I'm Szumowski  

🎓 **Computer Science student** at [WSB Merito University in Wrocław](https://www.merito.pl/).  
💡 My programming journey began back in middle school, where I started building simple websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**.  
⚙️ Over the years, I’ve developed various projects — from web applications to **IoT** and **embedded systems** using **ESP32**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **Arduino**.  
🤖 Currently, I’m working on a **BB-8 inspired droid**, combining my passion for **C++**, **IoT**, and robotics.  
🚀 I love bridging the gap between hardware and software to create smart, connected devices.
